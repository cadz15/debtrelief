                       Is Your Debt Obligation Secured or Unsecured?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="mt-12 md:px-0 px-4 text-lg text-justify">
                      To figure out which consumer debt relief option is best for you, we must first figure out what type of debt or obligation it is that you are having difficulties with as there are different options available for each.
                    </p>
                   <p class="mt-4">
                        A Secured debt or obligation is when you pledge an asset or multiple assets in order to get take out the loan or other debt.  Sometimes the asset is not a physical asset but can be your future income or money in your bank account.  The most common types or secured loans are mortgages, car loans, and payday loans.
                    </p>
                   <p class="mt-4">
                        An Unsecured debt or obligation one you obtained without having to put up any assets as collateral. It is called an unsecured because the obligation isn’t backed or secured by any assets.
                    </p>
                   <p class="mt-4">
                        Many obligations can start off as secured and become unsecured.  This is the case when the asset backing the debt or obligation is no longer in your possession or it loses value.  Even though the asset backing the obligation is no longer yours or no longer has value, the obligation itself remains.  The amount owed is called the “deficiency balance” or the “short amount” depending on the obligation being spoken of.

            <p class=" text-stone-50 text-justify mt-4" >
                Don’t let bad advice you may have heard from someone outside the industry or from a less than scrupulous company steer you wrong.  Most other companies want nothing more than to make a quick buck by taking advantage of those in need.  Their job is contingent upon selling their product and earning a commission for it – a sure way to make sure their products are misrepresented to you as their motivation is to sell you something.  These same types of companies typically only offer one service, not multiple services like our firm, so no matter what your situation is, their objective is to try to sell you their one service, whether it’s right for you and your situation or not.
            </p>

            <p class=" text-stone-50 text-justify mt-4" >
                On the contrary, we are a law firm and pay our debt consultants or client service representatives a salary not a commission.  Their job is not to sell you something as they are not paid based on how many clients the can enroll or anything of the sort – we do frequent compliance check-ups on each representative to make certain no will pressure you.
            </p>

            <p class=" text-stone-50 text-justify mt-4" >
                All of our representatives are well educated and more importantly are trained to be educators – as their job is to educate you.  To make sure YOU clearly understand all the ins and outs of all the services we offer.  That way YOU are able to make an educated decision.  We are a full disclosure law firm so we do our best to ensure that when retained, anything that can happen along the way will have already been disclosed and explained to you.  When we advise of the different choices we are sure to explain both the pros and the cons of each option.

            <p class=" text-stone-50 text-justify mt-4" style="color: white !important;">
                This means you will speak to the same person each time, should you need to contact us.  The representative that explains everything to you is the one that you will remain in contact with and will be up to date on your case.  This further ensures that they will do their best to tell you everything possible in store ahead in order to manage your expectations of whatever process it is that you choose to retain us for as you will build a relationship over time with the same person.  Our employee retention ratio is near 100% so the likelihood of your personal representative even leaving us is slim.  We have happy employees here and happy employees make for happy clients!
