            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                If you owe money to a collector and have fallen behind on your payments, that does not give a debt collector the right to violate your rights. Congress created the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) in 1977 to stop abusive practices by third-party debt collectors. The FDCPA forces consumer debt collectors to follow guidelines and regulates how they must behave when attempting to collect on a debt.  Many FDCPA violations occur on a daily basis. Many debt collectors deliberately violate FDCPA laws in hopes of pressuring you into a payment. These debt collectors think that you are not aware of your legal rights and that they can get away with violating the law.  What do you do when that happens?  You get an FDCPA Attorney on your side!
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                If you are unsure about whether your rights have been violated, you can call us for a free consultation.  We will review any collection correspondence you may have received from a collector potential violations for absolutely no charge! Not ready to call yet?  You can read the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to find out if a violation has occurred.  Pay specific attention to the following sections:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 font-bold mt-4 text-left">
                <li>805 – Communication in connection with Debt Collection</li>
                <li>806 – Harassment or Abuse</li>
                <li>807 – False or Misleading Information</li>
                <li>808 – Unfair Practices</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                Once you have determined that a violation has taken place or if you are unsure if a violation has occurred, you should call us today, and we will advise you of your rights. One of our attorneys or paralegals will be here to help you to determine what further actions you should take. You can fight back, and we are here to help you do just that! Don’t wait. The sooner you contact us, the sooner we can help to stop the harassment.

            <span class=" pt-12 block font-bold text-2xl" style="color: black;">Our NO FEE Promise!  FDCPA Attorney Violation Lawsuits</span>
                        
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                You do not have to let debt collectors get away with their violations. If a debt collector violates the rules and requirements of the FDCPA, you have the right to sue them using an FDCPA Attorney and receive money back. If a debt collector’s actions are deemed illegal and we are successful in your FDCPA claim, not only will the harassment stop, but the third-party debt collector will have to <b>pay you damages, in addition to your attorney and court fees, as well as up to $1,000 per violation.</b>
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                If we take further action on your behalf, and we do not win your case, you will not have to pay a fee. We only charge for FDCPA violation lawsuits on a contingency basis upon success, and at that point, <b>your collectors will have to pay our fees, not you, so you have nothing to lose!</b>
