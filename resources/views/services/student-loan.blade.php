                       Federally Backed Loans – Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                       One of the most critical differences in the Federally backed loans we come across is whether or not the loans were subsidized.  Being subsidized or not will tell you who is required to pay the loan interest while you’re in school. While you are in school or on deferment, the Federal Government pays the interest on subsidized loans, but with unsubsidized loans, you are responsible for the interest.  If the loan is unsubsidized, you are not required to pay the interest, but if you do not, the interest will accumulate and be compounded or capitalized into the outstanding balance.  If you can make payments while in school, you should, as doing so will help to reduce the overall total loan payback amount, as the interest will not compound on as large of a balance.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                       Each school has a different guideline as to the enrollment status that determines if you are at least part-time (also referred to as half-time) or not.  If you are no longer at least half-time status because you have either: graduated; are still attending some classes but are not enough to be considered half-time; have taken a leave of absence; or decided not to continue your schooling, then, unless your loans have been deferred, you will be required to make payments again once your grace period has come to an end.
