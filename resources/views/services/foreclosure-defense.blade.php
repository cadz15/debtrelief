            <span class=" pt-12 block font-bold text-2xl" style="color: black;">Financial Hardship Is <u>Not</u> a Foreclosure Defense</span>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                Foreclosure defense litigation aims to defend your home by any means possible but hardships you may have experienced are not actual legal defenses that will save your home from foreclosure.  It is not the job of the legal system to understand why you were unable to pay, but instead, whether or not there was an obligation for you to pay.  That means, if the reason you fell behind on your mortgage loan payments was due to a financial hardship like illness, unemployment, the birth of a child, Coronavirus related, etc., you cannot simply explain that to the judge and expect it to solve your problem.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                The most common defense typically involve proving fraudulent or unethical activities occurred either during the origination of the mortgage loan or the transfer of your note from one lender to the next.  Many banks were fined for wrongdoings and intentional fraudulent acts that the courts have been more frequently siding with the homeowners knowing they have been victims of many predatory actions by mortgage brokers, lenders, servicers, and foreclosure attorneys.  Even in the situation where your mortgage was originated properly and everything else was perfectly compliant, our attorneys can help delay the foreclosure as long as possible.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                If you want to keep your home, by defending the foreclosure we can allow time to try to renegotiate the terms of your loan to more affordable payments.  If you are trying to sell your property, foreclosure defense will allow you time to wait for the best offer rather than to be forced to accept a potential lower amount.  If you don’t want to keep your property and have tried to unsuccessfully sell, by defending the foreclosure we can work towards other solutions that will allow you to exit the property with the least amount of risk.  Some of our clients hire us Just to delay the foreclosure as long as possible while they remain in the home without paying.  There are very few situations in which foreclosure defense does not make sense, but most times, almost all solutions start with defending your home from foreclosure .

                       How We Defend Your Home From Foreclosure
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                        One of the ways our attorneys can try to defend your home from foreclosure is to have the bank prove they have ‘perfected’ the mortgage and now have the right to foreclose against you.  To have perfected means they have to prove they have the rights to the note, and that the note has been properly endorsed and the subsequent mortgage documents were recorded.  Perfection has to be proven from the time of the origination of the mortgage loan through the current time, meaning they have to show the records of any and all times the promissory note has changed hands from the time you closed on your loan until now.  This must be done to prove your current lender is in fact, the current owner of the note, and therefore is who is owed the money.  Any transfer that is not completely valid will invalidate the entire mortgage.

                      Your Promissory Note and Mortgage or Deed of Trust
                    </h3>
                    
                    <p> 
                        First off, you need to understand that your ‘note’ is a separate agreement from your ‘mortgage’ or your ‘deed of trust.’  The “note” is the agreement between you and your lender for you to repay the amount they lent you.  It states the amount lent, the payments, interest rates, etc.  A “mortgage” or “deed of trust,” is the agreement between you and your promissory note lender, that allows them to sell your property (through foreclosure) if you do not pay the note as agreed upon, to satisfy the full amount owed to them under the note.  Your mortgage or deed of trust is public record and gets recorded in the county where your property is located – the promissory note is not. 
                    </p>
                </div>
               
                <span class="block mt-4 text-gray-900 text-left text-xl font-bold">The foreclosure process in each state is different. One of the critical differences is whether or not your state records a ‘deed of trust’ or instead, records a ‘mortgage.’</span>

                <ul class="list-disc  text-left flex gap-2 flex-col">
                    <li>
                        <b>If your state records a mortgage</b>, your lender will have to sue you to foreclosure against your property.  These states are known as ‘judicial foreclosure’ states, and if you live in one, you are notified of a foreclosure action when you receive a ‘summons and complaint.’  Upon receiving the summons and complaint, you’ll have the opportunity to defend yourself and request proof of your lender’s right to foreclose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>If your state records a deed of trust</b>, your lender does not have to sue you to foreclosure against you.  States with these laws are known as ‘non-judicial’ states, and your lender can foreclose against your property without going through court in what’s called ‘statutory foreclosure’ by supplying you with notice of intent to foreclosure. This notice is what’s referred to as the ‘power of sale.’  To defend your home from foreclosure in a non-judicial state, you would need to sue in to contest the foreclosure action for a judge to postpone the sale.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        With this scam, a company will pretend to be your current mortgage lender or servicer and will offer to save your home from foreclosure if you pay them a lump sum. If this were actually your lender, this payment would be a called a reinstatement, and the amount would be quite significant to pay off all the past due payments, plus interest and fees.  The scam involves paying a much lower which is why it is so enticing, and you would be paying an unaffiliated party.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        Another scam is to have an individual or a company offer to pay you a lump sum of cash for your home at a price well below fair market value in exchange for the deed, with the promise you’ll be allowed to remain in your home for a period, usually several years.  As soon as the ink dries, they already have your property on the market for fair market value.  Once a buyer comes along, they sell your home out from under you giving you no notice.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        Another scam similar to the below-market cash payoff scam involves signing over the deed to your house with the promise that you’ll be able to stay there.  In reality, the new deed holder initiates what’s known as a ‘cash out refinance’ in which they use any equity in your home to apply for an equity loan.  They then take the cash and vanish, leaving you to deal with the foreclosure and without the equity you once had.

                        Still, other scams can be the reason you’re in foreclosure in the first place as there are less scrupulous loan modification companies that promise to lower your mortgage payments if you stop making payments to your lender – so you can pay them a fee instead!.  You should always make your payments if you can afford to and if you are in need of a modification, a reputable law firm can help regardless of whether or not you have fallen behind on your payments.
