                If you are being sued by a credit card company, debt collector or a 3rd party collector that has purchased (or is collecting on) your delinquent account, the Debt Lawyers at FCA national service.org can help. We have provided Debt Collection Lawsuit Defense to many clients in the same situation and can guide you in analyzing your budget to determine if we should assist with defending, postponing, or settling your lawsuit, or if we may need to help you to file for bankruptcy.    
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                In many instances, we have gotten cases dismissed with a well-prepared defense and have been able to settle other cases before they ever see a courtroom.  In other cases, the strategy has been to postpone as long as possible, thereby buying time and allowing a client to save funds that are used in a settlement agreement, thus avoiding a judgment.
            </p>

                      ABSOLUTELY!  If there is a judgment against you, your salary can now be garnished without being given any further notice.   If the judgment causing the garnishment was entered against you by way of default, we might be able to vacate the judgment and stop the garnishment.  That means if you were sued but weren’t served and therefore didn’t even know about the lawsuit, we may be able to fight the judgment and get it removed – along with the garnishment.  If the judgment is valid and you were served correctly but didn’t defend yourself or did defend and lost the case, then we can still help in other ways.

                   <p class="mt-4">
                    
                    If you received an income execution order to garnish your wages, most times, we can settle the judgment amount for less than the amount owed.  Although settlements in these cases are typically at higher payback percentages, any savings is better than paying the full amount plus interest, court fees, and Marshall or Sheriff fees.  Once you pay off the negotiated settlement amount, we will obtain a Letter of Satisfactory Judgment for you.  If you do not have the funds to settle, we help you work out a voluntary payment plan or file for bankruptcy if you qualify for it.

                ABSOLUTELY!  If there is a judgment against you, a lien can be placed against your property without being given any further notice.   If the judgment causing the property lien was entered against you by way of default, we might be able to vacate the judgment and remove the lien.  That means if you were sued but weren’t served and therefore didn’t even know about the lawsuit, we may be able to fight the judgment and get it removed – along with the lien.  If the judgment is valid and you were served correctly but didn’t defend yourself or did defend and lost the case, then we can still help in other ways.

                If there is a lien on your property, most times, we can settle the lien for less than the amount owed – before you try to sell or refinance, helping save thousands of dollars of your equity.  Once you pay off the negotiated amount, we will obtain an Order of Lien Release for you, which removes the lien from your property.   If you do not have the funds to settle in advance of your sale or refinance, we can even help you work out a payment plan or file for bankruptcy if you qualify for it.

                The summons and complaint you receive may often have a date on it that is already several weeks or months old.  Do not worry as the date you see is not the date from which the clock starts counting for you to submit a written answer to the court.  Typically when a debt collection law firm sues someone, they do not take a physical trip to the court each day to file their case or cases and purchase their index number then, but instead, make one trip every few weeks or sometimes months and buy a bunch of index numbers in bulk at one time.  Then over the upcoming weeks or months, they complete each lawsuit and index number with the information of the alleged debtor they are going to sue.  If you see an older date that is weeks or months before actually receiving the summons and complaint, all that means is the date the index number was purchased from the court an means nothing for your purposes.  The clock starts counting for your 20-30 days the day you receive the summons and complaint.
