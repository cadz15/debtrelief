                       Your creditors and collectors will know of our representation upon receiving a copy of your limiter power of attorney form and it enables us to take over all collection phone calls on your behalf before your petition is even filed!! This way you’ll spend less time listening to your phone ring and dealing with or hiding from collectors and can get back living your life!  Being stress free is just as important as being debt free!  If any 3rd party debt collector continues to contact you after receiving our power of attorney notification they are in violation of federal law and we can sue them for you and win you money which can help pay for your bankruptcy. Once your bankruptcy is filed, creditors are required to cease collection attempts so they cannot try to collect on your debts unless they go through the bankruptcy court system.

                       Since we only offer services for those struggling financially, our clients don’t have money to spare. Unlike a general practitioner that practices in numerous areas of law, we charge low fees, making our services affordable for anyone that needs help. Being that we are Debt Lawyers and only deal with clients in debt, if we charged fees like most other attorneys we wouldn’t have any clients that could afford us!  We are one of the few firms that can establish a payment plan for our clients to pay our fees over time making our services affordable to those in need.  We will start working on your case for as little as $100 down and will send a limited power of attorney forms to all your creditors and collectors notifying them not to contact you!

                       Bankruptcy is an excellent option for you if you’re overwhelmed by your debt – whether on time, slightly behind, way behind, being sued, or having major mortgage problems including foreclosure.  Even certain tax debts can be included in a bankruptcy filing. Though it is the least expensive debt relief option, there are long-term costs associated with a bankruptcy, so we only recommend it as a last resort to eliminate most or all of your debts.

                      Liens are Not Dischargeable by Filing Bankruptcy by Itself
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                       A lien will not be removed from when the underlying obligation is discharged.  No new liens can be filed as a result of debt discharged through bankruptcy so you won’t have to worry about new liens, bank freezes, or wage garnishments from the obligations that qualify for discharge.  This is the same with any type of lien whether tax-related or a judgment creditor lien.  Filing bankruptcy will relieve you of your responsibility to pay the debt; however, any liens entered prior to filing will remain.  If your assets are exempt as per your state or federal guidelines, a lien can be removed by filing a motion to avoid the lien (separately from your bankruptcy filing).  Judgment creditor lien avoidance will work in Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, but tax liens are only avoidable through Chapter 13.  When filing Bankruptcy, the amount of the lien you can avoid is the amount above, and beyond the equity exemption of the asset in question, the amount within the exemption will have to be paid.

You will end up paying back either a percentage of your debts or your debts in their entirety. Typically, secured debts are paid back first, then as much of your unsecured debts are paid back as possible.&nbsp; We offer free consultations so call today!</p>
