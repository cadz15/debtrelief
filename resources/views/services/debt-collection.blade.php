                If you are being sued by a credit card company, debt collector or a 3rd party collector that has purchased (or is collecting on) your delinquent account, the Debt Lawyers at FCA national service.org can help. We have provided Debt Collection Lawsuit Defense to many clients in the same situation and can guide you in analyzing your budget to determine if we should assist with defending, postponing, or settling your lawsuit, or if we may need to help you to file for bankruptcy.    
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                In many instances, we have gotten cases dismissed with a well-prepared defense and have been able to settle other cases before they ever see a courtroom.  In other cases, the strategy has been to postpone as long as possible, thereby buying time and allowing a client to save funds that are used in a settlement agreement, thus avoiding a judgment.
            </p>
