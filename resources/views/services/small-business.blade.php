            <span class=" pt-8 block font-bold text-2xl" style="color: black;">Why You Should NOT Collect Your Own Debts</span>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                While learning from past mistakes is great, dwelling in the past is not.  <b>Trying to collect your past due debts on your own after having already expended energy and not being paid in the first place is just compounding your losses.</b>  There are only so many hours in the day that having to deal with debts you’re owed on your own time means you’re taking time away from other aspects of your business that may warrant your attention.  As a business owner it would be more profitable to spend your time looking towards the future and new business or trying to figure out other ways to make your business more efficient and run smoother or become more profitable.  Your role should be managing the day to day operations of your business and dealing with any hiccups that arise not chasing after your customers or clients that are not paying you.
            </p>

            <span class=" pt-12 block font-bold text-2xl" style="color: black;">Your Employees Have Costs But NOT Guaranteed Results</span>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                Having your existing employees collect for you means paying their salary while they work.  If your employees are already overwhelmed, hiring new ones means laying out more salary, extra taxes, vacation expenses, health insurance, and other potential benefits that would need to be paid.  Then you’ll have to take the time to train the new employee and ask yourself honestly what debt collection experience do you even have to train them with?  Are your collection methods really the best methods that can be used?  If not, you are guaranteed to pay the costs associated with the employees’ labor that it will take you to find out if your techniques work or not!  Hopefully, you can save yourself those costs by just doing some simple research on outsourcing and how most companies are doing it in effort to REDUCE in house labor costs and expenses rather than increases them.  Wouldn’t it seem to make more sense to not have to pay anyone unless you were guaranteed to be collecting the money you are owed? Why pay guaranteed salaries to non-professional collectors when you only have to pay our professional debt collection attorneys when we collect?  <b>With our accounts receivable management service we don’t get paid unless you do…GUARANTEED!</b>
            </p>

            <span class=" pt-12 block font-bold text-2xl" style="color: black;">Trial and Error Wastes Time While Accounts Fall Further Behind</span>
                        
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                This is your money, from work you’ve already done and now you’re at risk of not getting paid and having all that time and effort go completely to waste.  In order to collect as much of your money as possible you need to get started right away and stay on top of it.  All studies conclude that the longer you wait to collect the less likely you are to collect.  Our collection methods that are time proven should be used as the first option not your last! There is no time to waste learning from your mistakes through trial and error while your money is falling further and further past due making it less likely to collect a dime with each passing day!  We have a practical, effective, streamlined and cost efficient process that is READY TO GO TO WORK FOR YOU TODAY to reduce the number of days past due money is owed to you and in turn will reduce the amount you are owed!  It is imperative that you act as soon as possible since those that owe you money most likely owe numerous other people or companies as well!  The longer you wait to collect the more likely it is that another company will be the early bird and collect whatever may be available leaving you left high and dry.

                          All businesses aren’t the same!  Your customers & clients aren’t the same either! We believe all collections efforts should not be the same and as such we cater our collection approaches specific not only to your line of business but also based on the different stages of account delinquency.  Some accounts that are just falling behind don’t require as harsh of collection efforts as those that are over 120 days behind although they should be treated with dignity and respect in any stage of their delinquency.  Doing so will help keep your good working relationships in place.  No matter the scenario, our hard work, dedication, and our level of professionalism will pay off in benefits for the short and long term.  Immediate benefits regarding money collected as a result of our efforts and long-term benefits by using our dignified collection efforts as not to damage your relationships, thereby allowing you the potential of repeat business from these very same clients or customers, after their delinquencies have been remedied.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                      We handle most of our collection activity on a contingency basis as a percentage of what we collect from you.  We have nothing to gain if we do not collect for you.   This puts us on the same page as the more we collect for you, the happier we both are!  With our lower than industry average fee structure formulated to keep your costs down, we know we cost you less when collecting what you are owed!  Just one of the ways doing business with our firm will add to more dollars in your pocket as money saved is more money earned back.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
                       Our typical charge ranges from 20-35% of what is collected depending on the size of the accounts, the number of accounts as well as a couple of other factors.  Please keep in mind all debts to be collected must be more than $15,000.00.  Any accounts in which legal action must commence the fees are slightly different which a representative will explain when you call.  Should the need arise for court costs, bank account searches, or skip traces, the fees for those services are the only required out of pocket expense.  We do offer discounts for larger placements, and we only get paid when you collect!  You have nothing to lose.
